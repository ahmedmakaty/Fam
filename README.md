# Fam

- I am using clean mvvm architecture with rxjava

- I am using retrofit for remote network layer and dagger for dependency injection

- I am using a design to demonstrate all the article details in a clean way

- All the code used in this project is mine (Except for the shimmer recycler view which adds a good animation to the list items while loading)
